# Membership

## Become a member?
Anyone can join our association and participate in our (optional) activities, provided they support our core values, norms, and principles.

Contact us if you wish to become a member. Participation in activities is always on a voluntary basis. You can cancel your membership at any time.

## News via digital channels
Members are kept informed about activities through digital channels such as WhatsApp groups and social media. By offering updates, developments, and news via these channels, we align with the digital trends in society. Working digitally enables us to provide information quickly and save on paper, costs, and time.

## Membership fees
- **Family membership**: €20 per month (€240 annually). Only one family member needs to register; other family members can then join or attend activities at no additional cost.
- **Individual membership**: €10 per month (€120 annually).

## Additional costs
For some activities, a small contribution may be requested (e.g., to cover transportation costs).

## Paying membership fees
It is best to pay your membership fee in one lump sum, either at the end of the year for the upcoming calendar year or at the beginning of the year in January. We do not process direct debits; you transfer the amount yourself. For convenience, you can also pay via an app (such as Tikkie or an ING payment request).

## Difficulty paying membership fees?
If reduced income or declining purchasing power makes it difficult to pay your membership fees, and you prefer to allocate your income to other priorities—such as your children's sports club—please feel free to contact us. Together, we will find a solution. We believe it's important for members to continue participating in activities regardless of their financial situation.

## How do we use membership fees?
Membership fees are solely used to fund activities and maintain the association's building (including costs such as mortgage, utilities, local taxes, and necessary furnishings). The association relies entirely on volunteer work from our members.

## Donations are welcome
Would you like to support us without becoming a member? Consider making a donation. As an independent association with limited resources, we appreciate every contribution. Donations are used solely for funding activities and maintaining the association’s building. If you’d like to donate or discuss your donation, please contact us.
