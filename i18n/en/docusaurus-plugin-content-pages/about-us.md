# Pir Sultan Abdal Culture and Solidarity Association

Pir Sultan Abdal Culture and Solidarity Association (Turkish: **P**ir **S**ultan **A**bdal K√ºlt√ºr ve Dayanƒ±≈üma **Der**neƒüi, PSA-Der) is a socio-cultural (migrant) association established in 1995 in Enschede. Our association is named after the 15th-century Turkish poet, musician, humanist, and mystic [Pir Sultan Abdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_Sultan_Abdal). Currently, our association has around 200 members.

## What kind of association are we?

Our association is difficult to categorize under a single label. We see ourselves as a progressive association... a migrant association... an association with an [Alevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevism) background... an association with humanist principles... a social association that actively engages with society... an advocacy group for our members... an association that fosters cohesion among like-minded people and groups. In short, we are a broad association with diverse principles!

## What do we do?

Our association has various objectives in the fields of culture, religion, and society. One of our goals is to preserve the centuries-old [Alevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevism) culture and religion. We aim to pass this on to future generations and share it with those unfamiliar with it. Our [Alevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevism) identity is reflected in our **modern, contemporary** interpretation of humanity, society, and religion.

Additionally, we perform social and community functions, such as providing support during bereavements, funerals, and memorial services. Other activities include family evenings, informational meetings, music lessons, homework assistance, organizing lectures, book presentations, and music and theater performances.

We also organize events around specific days, such as [Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz) (spring equinox) and [International Women's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day). Additionally, we participate in public demonstrations (e.g., trade union rallies) or fundraising efforts.

To achieve our goals, we collaborate with other institutions and associations that share democratic, multicultural, and tolerant values. Many issues require cooperation and connection between different groups, individuals, and societal organizations.

## What are our values, norms, and principles?

We adhere to and promote the following principles:

- Everyone should be able to be themselves and develop freely, with room for personal autonomy, growth, freedom of expression, reason, and critique. We treat each other and others with respect. üê£
- We help each other whenever possible. We are socially supportive within and outside our community. üë´
- We embrace diversity, variety, and pluralism: there is room and respect for others' differences. We emphasize that no (discriminatory) distinctions should be made based on origin, ethnicity, skin color, appearance, nationality, language, physical disabilities, faith, religious sects, gender, or sexual orientation. We reject prejudice and generalizations. Everyone deserves to be treated equally and humanely. ‚òÆ
- We strive for full citizenship and integration into Dutch society, highlighting the importance of education and equal opportunities in the labor market. We value individuals who achieve something in life through education or work. From janitor to scientist, we celebrate all work! üë∑
- We prioritize women's emancipation, including self-determination (such as the right to abortion and free partner choice), progress through education, and the eradication of violence against women. üë©
- We show solidarity with human rights worldwide and support causes such as environmental conservation, sustainability, and economic progress for all. üåç

## Organizational structure

Our association has a flat organizational structure with short communication lines. The board is elected at a general meeting for a two-year term and consists of at least seven members. From within, the board appoints a chairperson, a secretary, a treasurer, and the necessary number of supporting members.

In addition to the board, there are several committees:
- The **Women‚Äôs Committee** organizes activities for female members.
- The **Youth Committee** organizes activities for and by young members.
- The **Cem Committee** oversees religious activities (depending on interest) such as Cem, Hƒ±zƒ±r, Muharrem, Ashura, Hz. Ali, Hƒ±dƒ±rellez, Hacƒ± Bekta≈ü Veli, Khal Gaxan/Gaƒüan, etc.

Unfortunately, we do not have a dedicated [Cemevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemevi) for religious activities and use the regular facilities in our community center.

We are affiliated with [Hak-Der](https://hakder.nl), the umbrella organization of [Alevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevism) associations in the Netherlands. [Hak-Der](https://hakder.nl) collaborates with the Humanist Alliance, an organization of humanist groups in the Netherlands.
